# Attendance-monitoring-system---Design-
This project is a Attendance Monitoring System built around a custom-designed PCB using the ESP32-S3-WROOM-2. The system automates attendance logging by integrating biometric fingerprint authentication, RFID-based identification, and a display interface, making it suitable for academic or organizational environments.
